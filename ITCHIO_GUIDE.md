# How to Package Your Game for Itch.io

To publish your game on Itch.io, you need to create a `.zip` file containing all the necessary game files. The server-side code does not need to be included.

## Files and Folders to Include

Create a `.zip` file with the following files and folders:

- `index.html`
- `favicon.svg`
- `js/` (the entire folder)
- `assets/` (the entire folder)
- `styles/` (the entire folder)

## Instructions

1.  Select all the files and folders listed above.
2.  Right-click on the selected files.
3.  Choose "Send to" -> "Compressed (zipped) folder".
4.  Name the zip file whatever you like (e.g., `space-drift-arena.zip`).
5.  Upload this single zip file to your project on Itch.io and configure it as an HTML5 game.
